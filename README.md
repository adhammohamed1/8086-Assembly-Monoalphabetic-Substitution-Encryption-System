This assembly program can be run using the emulator emu8086.
it encrypts/decrypts a given string according to the table below

The program also omits any spaces in the result but I have clearly indicated the location of the part that does that in the code with comments so you can remove it at will.

Sample run using emu8086:

The string we will operate on is this:
